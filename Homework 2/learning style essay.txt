I strongly feel that learning styles affect how we learn. For example, when people study for tests, everyone has a different way of studying. I used to wonder why people study so differently, but this topic helped me understand those differences.

I found that I am a tactile learner, and I really think that is true. When I read about the other learning styles, I felt that many of those traits did not match me. Because of this, I realized that the way we learn best can be very different from person to person.
