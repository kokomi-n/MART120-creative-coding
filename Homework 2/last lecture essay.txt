The message that stayed with me the most was the story about “walls.” He said that walls are not there to make us give up. They are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want to achieve our dreams. Walls are there to stop the people who are not serious enough.

This message really touched me because I am an international student from Japan. I study in my second language, and I have faced many “walls” in my life. Every time I hit a wall, I used to feel how powerless and incapable I was. But after hearing that walls have a reason, I feel like I will spend less time feeling hopeless when I face difficulties in the future. I can try to see them as chances to grow instead.

Another message that touched me was that the best way to make the world a better place is to stand next to others and smile. Even though he had such an extraordinary life, he still believed that something so simple could make the world better. That idea really stayed in my heart.

The parts I related to were these messages:
As we get older, it becomes more interesting to help other people achieve their dreams than to only chase our own.
People who criticize you honestly, like family, do it because they love you.
Sometimes we show the most strength when we feel like we have nothing to lose.
Indirect learning is also very important.

I felt that these ideas connected to my own experiences. He was clearly a genius and lived an extraordinary life, but he was still human. He built his success step by step and never gave up. That gives me hope. Knowing that this was his “last lecture” after being told he did not have much time left made his words even more powerful and gave me a lot of courage.
