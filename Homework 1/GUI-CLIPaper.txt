GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command-Line Interface) are two ways to interact with a computer.

A GUI uses visual elements like icons, windows, and buttons. It is easy to use and good for beginners because users can click instead of typing commands.

A CLI uses text commands that users type into a terminal. It can be harder to learn, but it is faster and more powerful for advanced users.

In conclusion, GUI is better for everyday users, while CLI is better for users who need more control and efficiency.
